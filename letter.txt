Dear sir/madame

  Please find attached a paper entitled "Identification of The Three
  Distinct Fold Types of the CPA/AT Superfamily." by Govindarajan et
  al.  We do believe this paper to be suitable to be published in JMB
  as it provides insights into how all families in the CPA/AT
  superfamily are related. The CPA/AT superfamily is one of the most
  important and wide-spread transporters and transports a variety of
  compounds in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 

 In particular we do highlight that families in CPA/AT transporter
 superfamily consists of inverted repeat structures but that these can
 be divided into "broken" and "reentrant" types. Using an integrated
 topology annotation we classify the topology of the members of the
 CPA/AT superfamily.  We identify three fold types: 5-helical-broken,
 6-helical-reentrant, and 7-helical-broken.  This leads us to
 propose a novel structural hierarchy (1)Superfamily (2)Fold-type (3)
 Family (4) Subfamily, where all members of each subfamily (but not
 necessarily family) have a unique topology. Using evolutionary
 analysis we show that the 6-helical-reentrant and 7-helical-broken
 fold types are more closely related and that the 5-helical-broken is
 the outlier. Further, we identify three evolutionary distinct
 fold-types identified based on repeat units: gain/loss of helices,
 change in orientation, and the broken-reentrant switch. These occurs
 at different levels in the hierarchical classification.




  Here follows the abstract of the paper (a pdf is attached):

 The CPA/AT transporter superfamily transports a variety of compounds,
 including ions, amino acids, bile acid and auxin. All known families
 in this superfamily consists of an inverted repeat structure, in most
 cases the N and C-terminal subdomains have identical (but inverted)
 topologies, but in some cases there exist one or more additional
 helices in one of the subdomains. Here, we show that the
 evolutionary related proteins in this superfamily contain
 unprecedented changes in their topology. This identifies the
 existence of several novel families with either broken and reentrant
 helical transporters using an integrated topology annotation
 method. Using these annotations, we define a hierarchy of topology
 and evolutionary relatedness; (i) the CPA/AT Superfamily, (ii)
 Fold-type, (iii) Family and (iv) Subfamily. We identified three
 evolutionary distinct fold-types based on the repeat units; the 5
 helical broken fold-type, the 6 helical reentrant fold-type and the 7
 helical broken fold-type. Each fold type can be made up of families
 of same/different topologies. Few families can be further made up of
 subfamilies with different topologies (Pfam families Na_H_Exchanger,
 SBF and Cons_hypoth698). Topology variations are due to the
 addition/deletion of helices in the scaffold subdomain. We also
 identified subfamilies (cons_hypoth698_1 and cons_hypoth698_2) that
 have a truncated C terminal core subdomain.  Families with a complete
 change in orientation were also observed both among the broken and
 reentrant types. Finally, we show that the transition between the
 broken and reentrant types is accompanied by the gain/loss of helices
 in the scaffold subdomain.
